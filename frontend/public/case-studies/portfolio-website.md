# Portfolio Website

### Overview

This **portfolio website** is a full-stack web application built with **Spring Boot (Java)** backend and **React + TypeScript** frontend, designed to showcase my technical skills and professional projects in a clean, modern interface.  
The project demonstrates proficiency in both frontend and backend development, with a focus on responsive design, modular architecture, and production-ready deployment practices.

---

### Purpose

The goal of this project was to create a **professional portfolio platform** that effectively presents my work while demonstrating my ability to build full-stack applications using modern technologies.  
It serves as both a showcase of my projects and a technical demonstration of clean code, responsive UI design, and scalable backend architecture.

### Architecture & Implementation

The platform follows a **clean separation** between frontend and backend services:

- **Backend (Spring Boot):**  
  RESTful API built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot**, providing endpoints for projects, skills, and contact functionality.  
  Features include comprehensive project data management, skill categorization, and structured contact form handling.

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript):**  
  Modern **React** application with **TypeScript** for type safety and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling.  
  Implements client-side routing, reusable components, and interactive project showcases with case study integration.

- **Deployment & CI/CD:**  
  Automated deployment pipeline using **GitHub Actions** with **Docker** containerization.  
  Separate frontend and backend deployments with environment-specific configurations.

- **Design & UX:**  
  Clean, professional interface with consistent styling, interactive project cards, and smooth navigation.  
  Responsive design ensuring optimal viewing across desktop and mobile devices.
